= Monitoring your Application with AxonIQ Console

Now we come to the exciting part of this guide, where we will see AxonIQ Console in action: We will be able to introduce problems in our application (or start some small fires) and use AxonIQ Console to detect these problems.

The steps in this section are broken down into:

1. First, we will look at xref:monitoring/your-app-in-axoniq-console.adoc[overview of all the information AxonIQ Console displays about our application] behavior. We will walk you through the AxonIQ Console dashboard to familiarize you with it.
2. To see the real power of AxonIQ Console, we will xref:monitoring/add-axon-firestarter.adoc[introduce Axon FireStarter]. A library that allows you to introduce some delays and errors at certain points of your Axon Framework-based application.
3. With Axon Firestarter added, we can xref:monitoring/issues-w-firestarter.adoc[make our application misbehave and see how AxonIQ Console detects those problems].

Proceed to the next section to continue.
