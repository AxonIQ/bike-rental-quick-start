image::image$logic-diagram.png[Design diagram with the logical modules for rental application: An UI/API module contains the HTTP Controller that receives the HTTP POST request to register a new bike. The HTTP Controller sends a RegisterBikeCommand to the Command Model module, including a CommandHandler to maintain the Bike aggregates. After processing a RegisterBikeCommand, the CommandHandler sends a BikeRegisteredEvent to the Query Model module, which keeps a Projection with the data stored on a DB. The Projection on the QueryModel also receives and handles a GetBikesQuery that can be sent from another Controller in the UI/API module.]
