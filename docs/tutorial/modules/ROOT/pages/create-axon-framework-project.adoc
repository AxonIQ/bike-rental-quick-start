= Create New Axon Framework Multi-Project
:navtitle: Create New Project
:reftext: Creating A New AxonFramework Project


For our sample application, we will create a multi-module maven project containing only two modules: a `core-api` module containing the API definition and messages used within the application and a `rental` module containing the business logic for our bike rental application.

== Project structure

We will design our rental module as a *modular monolith*, which means that we will keep a single project, but with the logic components decoupled so that it is easy to split the module into different pieces later.

First, we need to create a new project and configure the AxonFramework dependencies that will help us focus on the business code.

We will create a maven project with the following structure:

[listing]
.Bike Rental demo application structure
----
ðŸ“’ bike-rental <.>
  ðŸ“’ core-api <.>
    ðŸ“‚ src
      ðŸ“‚ main
        ðŸ“‚ java
           ðŸ“¦ io.axoniq.demo.bikerental.coreapi <.>
    ðŸ“„ pom.xml <.>
  ðŸ“’ rental <.>
    ðŸ“‚ src
      ðŸ“‚ main
        ðŸ“‚ java
           ðŸ“¦ io.axoniq.demo.bikerental.rental <.>
    ðŸ“„ pom.xml <.>
  ðŸ“„ pom.xml <.>
----

<.> The `bike-rental` root project is the parent project that will contain all the modules from our application. This root project will define `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-parent` as its parent to configure SpringBoot support for all the modules.
<.> The `core-api` project will contain the API and definition of the messages used to communicate the different modules.
<.> The `io.axoniq.demo.bikerental.coreapi` is the package where we will place our classes with the definition of `Commands`, `Events`, and `Queries` exchanged between different modules.
<.> The `pom.xml` maven descriptor contains the dependency declaration for the `core-api` project and links to `bike-rental` as its parent project.
<.> The `rental` module will be our starting point to place the business logic of our application.
<.> The `io.axoniq.demo.bikerental.rental` package is where we will add the code for our application.
<.> The `pom.xml` maven descriptor will include the dependencies required for the `rental` module. It also declares `bike-rental` as its parent and inherits any dependency declaration from that project.
<.> Finally, the `pom.xml` maven descriptor at the root `bike-rental` project keeps the common dependency definition inherited in all the submodules. It also keeps the list of `<modules>` that form part of the project.


If you are already experienced with Maven and/or your IDE, you can just create a multi-maven project with the structure described here and move to the next step of this tutorial to xref:bootstraping-axonframework.adoc[configure Axon Framework in your project.]

If you prefer to follow step-by-step instructions to create the project, keep reading through  the following sections in this step:

== Create the root project
We will use Maven as the build tool for this project. We aim to create a multi-module project that allows us to deploy each module independently later when -and if- our application reaches the point at which we need to split it and scale out.

We will start by creating the root project containing the different modules or subprojects. This type corresponds to a maven project with the `packaging` property set to `pom`.

You can create the project from your console terminal with the following maven command:

[source,shell]
----
 mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.codehaus.mojo.archetypes \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=pom-root \
  -DarchetypeVersion=RELEASE \
  -DgroupId=io.axoniq.demo.bikerental \
  -DartifactId=bike-rental \
  -Dversion=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT \
  -DinteractiveMode=false
----

Maven will create a `bike-rental` folder with a maven project descriptor file: `pom.xml`. You can import the project into your favorite IDE.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can use your preferred IDE to create the project, making sure to set the following project properties:

[horizontal]
archetypeGroupId:: org.codehaus.mojo.archetypes
archetypeArtifactId:: pom-root
archetypeVersion:: RELEASE
groupId:: io.axoniq.demo.bikerental
artifactId:: bike-rental
version:: 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
====

To configure Java 21 for our project, add these properties to the pom.xml file:

[source,xml]
----
include::example$root/pom.xml[tags=properties;!props-axonframework;!props-axoniq-console-client]
----

=== Configuring SpringBoot
Now that we have our root project, we need to configure it to use SpringBoot. We can configure the SpringBoot dependencies in our project in two ways: the first one is by adding them under the `<dependencyManagement>` section of the root `pom.xml` file.

Alternatively, we can make our root project depend on `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-parent', which already defines all the dependencies needed to use SpringBoot in our projects.

We will use the second option. Open your `pom.xml` and add the following snippet right before the `<groupId>` tag:

[source,xml]
----
include::example$root/pom.xml[tag=spring-boot-starter-parent]
----

== Create the project modules
We will start by creating a main module for our bike rental application. This module will contain the business logic.

Our goal with AxonIQ technologies is to focus on a single application and avoid unnecessary complexity by dealing with multiple modules immediately. However, we aim to build our module in a way that allows for easy evolution into different modules. This design is what we call a *modular monolith*.

=== Creating the main rental module

Our main module will be the `rental` module. To create it, you can use your IDE to add a new module, or you can use the following maven command from the root bike-rental folder:

[source,shell]
----
 mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=io.axoniq.demo.bikerental -DartifactId=rental -Dpackage=io.axoniq.demo.bikerental.rental -DinteractiveMode=false
----

After running the `mvn` command you will see a new `rental` directory with a `rental/pom.xml` file, which declares the project as a sub-module of the root project:

.rental/pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::example$rental/pom.xml[tag=parent]
----

At the same time, the execution of the `mvn` command also modified the maven project descriptor of the root project to include the new module:


./pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::example$root/pom.xml[tags=modules;mod-rental;!*]
----

Your IDE should now show the new project as a submodule.

NOTE: If the IDE does not detect the new module, you may have to refresh the project structure and reload the Maven projects in your IDE.

=== Creating the core-api subproject

Although we are going to code our business logic in a single `rental` module, we also have already mentioned that we want to be able to split our project into different modules when we need to evolve into multiple modules (or microservices).

So, we are going to have a module in which we will include the definitions of the messages and classes that are used to communicate the different modules. We will name this project as `core-api`.

To create the `core-api` submodule, use your IDE to create a new Module (make sure you create it using the root project as the parent), or you can use the following maven command from the root project's folder:

[source,shell]
----
 mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=io.axoniq.demo.bikerental -DartifactId=core-api -Dpackage=io.axoniq.demo.bikerental.coreapi -DinteractiveMode=false
----

After executing the command, you should see a new core-api project with a `pom.xml` file declaring the root project as the parent:

./core-api/pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::example$core-api/pom.xml[tag=parent]
----

And the maven descriptor in the root project now should also include the `core-api` as a module:

./pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::example$root/pom.xml[tags=modules;mod-rental;mod-core-api;!*]
----

Your IDE should recognize the two sub-projects as modules.

NOTE: If the IDE does not detect the new module, you may have to refresh the project structure and reload the Maven projects in your IDE.

=== Add dependencies for the main rental module

As the last step in creating the multi-module structure for our project, we will declare that the main `rental` module will use the `core-api` module.

To do that, declare the following dependency in the maven descriptor file for the `rental` module:

.rental/pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
include::example$rental/pom.xml[tags=dependencies;deps-core-api;!*]
----

After completing this last step your project should have the structure that we described in the <<_project_structure,Project Structure section>> at the begining of this step.

Once that we have our project created, in the next step, we will learn how to bootstrap Axon Framework in our project.
