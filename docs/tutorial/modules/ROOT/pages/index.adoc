Building a new application from scratch can be daunting, especially when learning something new. This tutorial will guide you through the various stages of development, starting with creating your first project and explaining the capabilities of Axon Framework and Axon Server.

The result is a simple application you can deploy in "production". The tutorial then shows you how to evolve the application, make changes, and deploy it in different scenarios.

This tutorial will guide you through the creation of a "Bike Rental Application" using Axon Framework and Axon Server.
